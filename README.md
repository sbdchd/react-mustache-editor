# react-mustache-editor

An attempt at making a basic editor for inserting [mustache
templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustache_%28template_system%29) and
rendering them with a custom element.

So far have tried [SlateJS](https://www.slatejs.org/examples/richtext) which
has a couple troubling bugs.

[DraftJS](https://draftjs.org) has problems around emoji.

Next thing to try: <https://prosemirror.net>

## dev

yarn install
yarn start
```
